					<h1> About </h1><!-- Home, About us, Contact, etc. -->
				
					<p>We at San Luis Coast Surf Shop are fueled by creative freedom and a shared love for the ocean. Nestled in one of the most well-known surf communities in California, our crew has developed a unique modern approach inspired from classic, old school styles.
In and out of the water, we promote self-expression and  are growing to influence others around the globe. In October of 2017 we opened our shop in San Luis Obispo, California. Our dream is for the shop to be a place where people can come hang out, talk surf, say hi and connect with what San Luis Coast Surf Shop is about.
