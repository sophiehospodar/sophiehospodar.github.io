            <p>We opened our doors in historic San Luis Obispo, California in 2019. From there the momentum and enthusiasm carried us! We now operate a robust roasting operation, our central kitchen and six thriving cafes. Cafe con Leche works exclusively with coffee growers who support sustainable farming and business practices, and our expertly roasted coffee has been awarded ‘Best In San Luis Obispo county’. Our cafes offer full breakfast and lunch menus that highlight local farm partnerships. Our intention is to create an exceptional and authentic experience where everyone feels welcome.</p>
